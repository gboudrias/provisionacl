REQUIREMENTS
============

Make sure you have the acl utils, the 'acl' package in Debian.

USAGE
=====

To make this work the unix username should match the hostmaster username,
and the client internal name should match a unix group the user is a member of.

Example commands:
addgroup <client intername name>
adduser <hostmaster username>
adduser <hostmaster username> <client intername name>


CAVEATS
=======

Multi server setups have only had limited testing.
ACL needs to be enabled on all servers.

The --acls option needs to be added to rsync calls. (See https://drupal.org/node/2179151)

Adding this line to one of the drushrc.php config files.
  $options['global_sync_options']['acls'] = TRUE;
